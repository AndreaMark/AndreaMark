    - 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea Marchegiani!
    - 👀 I'm interested in music (I play the piano!), science, books, astrophysics, video games, astronomy, outdoor activities, and photography.
    - 🌱 I'm always learning MatLab, Python, and LaTeX!
    - 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on highly scientific projects, maybe in the future...
